I I I I, I I I I
I I I I, I I I I
I I I I, I I I I, I I
You stand with your hand on my waist line (I I I I, I I I I)
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight (I I I I, I I I I)
I can hear them whisper as we pass by (I I I I, I I I I)
It's a bad sign, bad sign (I I)
Something happens when everybody finds out (I I I I, I I I I)
See the vulture circling dark clouds (I I I I, I I I I)
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out (I I I I, I I I I)
It could burn out (I I)
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes (I I I I, I I I I)
And guns, they are the hunters, we are the foxes (I I I I, I I I I)
And we run
Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places
I know places
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences (I I I I, I I I I)
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it (I I I I, I I I I)
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time, not this time (I I I I, I I I I, I I)
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it (I I I I, I I I I)
My love, they are the hunters, we are the foxes (I I I I, I I I I, I I)
And we run
Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places
They take their shots, but we're bulletproof
I know places
(I) And you know for me it's always you
I know places
(I) In the dead of night, you're eyes so green
I know places
(I) And I know for you it's always me
I know places
